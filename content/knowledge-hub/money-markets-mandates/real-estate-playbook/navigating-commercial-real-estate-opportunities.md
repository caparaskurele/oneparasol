Introduction

(Article ~700-900 words: underwriting rent rolls, cap rates, stress-testing leverage, due diligence, tax and structuring considerations, exit planning.)
 
Underwriting fundamentals
Start with net operating income (NOI): validate leases, tenant credit, escalations and vacancy assumptions. Use market comparables for cap rate sanity checks.

Leverage and stress testing
Model interest shocks and vacancy spikes. Keep covenant headroom and plan liquidity for capex cycles.

Asset management
Active asset managers improve yield: lease renegotiations, value-add capex and selective re-tenanting can materially improve returns.

Exit considerations
Project hold-period returns under multiple scenarios; plan sale timing and transaction costs. Tax and local regulations can materially change net proceeds.

Conclusion
Commercial real estate returns come from underwriting, active management and disciplined leverage. Be conservative and model downside explicitly.
