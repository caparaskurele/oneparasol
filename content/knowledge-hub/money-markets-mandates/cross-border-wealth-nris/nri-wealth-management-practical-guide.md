Introduction

(Article ~700-900 words: residency definitions, repatriation methods, double taxation treaties, investment vehicles, estate planning basics for NRIs.)
 
Residency and tax footprint
Clarify residency tests early — tax residence drives obligations. Review applicable DTAA clauses and FTC availability.

Repatriation and currency planning
Choose mechanisms (dividends, sale proceeds) and model FX, withholding taxes and timing to optimize net flows.

Estate and succession basics
Use local will structures and consider cross-border probate challenges; coordinate advisors in both jurisdictions.

Conclusion
Cross-border wealth requires early planning and coordination between tax, legal and investment advisors to avoid surprises.
