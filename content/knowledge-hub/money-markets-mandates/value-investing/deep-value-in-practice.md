Introduction

(Article ~700-900 words follows — practical sections on screening, intrinsic value, margin of safety, portfolio sizing, monitoring, pitfalls and exit rules.)
 
Screening and idea generation
Use quantitative filters: low P/E vs sector, low EV/EBITDA, depressed cash conversion and improving ROIC trends. Combine with qualitative checks: durable franchises, capital allocation history and management incentives.

Estimating intrinsic value
Prefer simple FCF-backed approaches for steady businesses. Build a 3-case model (base, conservative, optimistic) and document assumptions; where cash flows are noisy, use asset-backed or liquidation floors.

Margin of safety and sizing
Apply a margin of safety (20–40% depending on uncertainty). Size positions based on conviction and liquidity — highest conviction positions get modestly larger weights, but avoid concentration risk.

Monitoring and triggers
Focus on business fundamentals, not daily price action. Monitor revenue/margin stability, cash conversion and management actions. Have clear exit triggers (deterioration of fundamentals, full valuation realization or better opportunities).

Common traps
Avoid value traps (structural decline, poor governance) and over-leveraging. Be humble — wrong assumptions can persist for long periods.

Conclusion
Deep value is disciplined work: rigorous screening, conservative valuation, explicit margins of safety and an unemotional holding discipline.
