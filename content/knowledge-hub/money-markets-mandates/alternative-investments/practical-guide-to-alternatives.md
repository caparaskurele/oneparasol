Introduction

(Article ~700-900 words: investor suitability, due diligence, fee structures, liquidity management, portfolio allocation and diversification roles.)
 
Key considerations
Understand strategy, return drivers, liquidity profile and fee alignment. Use third-party diligence and reference checks.

Portfolio role and sizing
Treat alternatives as diversifiers or return enhancers; size by liquidity needs and conviction. Avoid over‑allocating to highly illiquid strategies.

Conclusion
Alternatives can add value but require disciplined access, fee awareness and realistic liquidity planning.
