Influence is a multiplier: better communication and meeting design increases team velocity. This short guide covers three high‑leverage habits.

Clear, outcome-oriented communication
Open with the decision you want. Use a 1–2 sentence framing, the key data point, and the recommended action. Prefer short written summaries for asynchronous stakeholders.

Meeting design
Set objectives, timeboxes and desired decisions. Share pre-reads and use a parking-lot for deep dives. End with explicit next steps and owners.

Feedback loops
Use a check-in rhythm: 1:1s with clear agendas, post-mortems focused on learning, and timely praise/redirect. Practice specific, behavior-based feedback.

Conclusion
Consistent application of these habits builds influence and makes teams more effective.
