Microlearning converts intent into skill by focusing on deliberate practice, feedback and small projects. This guide shows how to design 8‑week learning routes.

Structure: weeks 1–2 fundamentals, 3–6 deliberate practice + mini‑project, 7–8 synthesis, showcase and feedback. Include weekly measurable outputs and a mentor review.

Tools and assessment
Use short quizzes, code kata, or case writeups for assessment. Keep deliverables small and review-focused.

Conclusion
Microlearning with projects and mentor feedback yields faster, durable skill gains than passive courses.
