Promotion results from visible impact, sponsor advocacy and structured skill development. This playbook focuses on measurable signals, portfolio of projects and cultivating sponsors.

Visible impact
Deliver outcomes that matter to leaders: cost savings, revenue wins or customer retention improvements. Use a concise one‑page summary for each major deliverable that shows before/after metrics.

Skill portfolio
Maintain a 3‑area skill portfolio: role fundamentals, adjacent skills (data, product or commercial), and leadership behaviors. Update quarterly with small experiments to demonstrate capability.

Sponsorship and network
Identify 1–2 sponsors who can advocate for you. Build relationships by helping them solve problems and ensuring they know the outcomes you’ve driven.

Promotion conversation
Prepare a one‑page promotion brief: accomplishments, business impact, examples of stretch work and a 12‑month plan for the next role.

Conclusion
Promotions are a predictable outcome of consistent impact, visibility and sponsor alignment. Make progress visible and structure your work to create promotable evidence.
